Atulye Krishi Vana offers a practical and impactful solutionâ€”Multi-Layer Farming, a method that turns even a small piece of land into a productive and organic source of livelihood. Our 15-day residential training program is specially designed for marginal farmers, landless labourers, women farmers, and rural youth. This training empowers participants to grow multiple crops organically in the same space, generate steady income, and reduce dependence on chemicals and external inputs.  ",
